# Blender for scientists

## INTRODUCTION

Blender is a software with a steep learning curve and the first hours of hands-on can be traumatic. 
I try to collect here some useful tutorial and workflows that can be used in scientific video and images.

## RESOURCES

A collection on youtube channels with useful tutorials:

### The Blender Guru Donut Serie

This is a series of tutorials based on a donut, starting from modeling and bringing it to the last phase of production (rendering and video editing).

### CGFigures tutorials

Dr. Joseph G. Manion wrote a collection of tutorials on Blender for scientists.

[Blender and Science](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEIPcyNDTv8&list=PLcKSD7d0T-HADHS9DHsIfMhso8FLIkReM)

There is also a huge asset library with interesting resources: 

[CGFigures Assets](https://drive.google.com/file/d/13XNjSc-1tvu_PbYemllN7nUGf7vqGc1O/view?usp=sharing)

To install the library in your Blender instance:

1. Download and unzip the library
2. Move the library somewhere (in OSX I can suggest: `~/Documents/Blender/`)
3. Open Blender
4. Go to `Edit` --> `Preferences` --> `File Paths` --> `Asset Libraries`
5. Set as Import Method `Append` (without Reuse)
6. Save preferences
7. Open a window with asset browser: you now have a huge library of scientific models!

Of course there is also a tutorial on how to use the library in your project:
