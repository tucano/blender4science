# Molecular Nodes

Molecular Nodes (MN) is an addon for the 3D modelling & animation program Blender. MN enables easy import of molecular data such as `.pdb` & `.mmCIF`, along with a variety of molecular dynamics trajectories and topologies from a variety of simulation sources. Other data formats including electron microscopy (EM) `.map`, EM tomography files such as `.map` and `.star`, with the potential to support more data formats as well.
